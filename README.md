Cursor and Continue rules.

This is a collection of rules that are optimised for use with AI coding tools. They have been optimized to be very efficient in terms of token consumption. 

## Usage:
Copy files to your project directory under .cursor/rules or .continue/rules or in ${HOME}/.continue/rules

Please suggest improvements and feedback on the rules. Thank you!
